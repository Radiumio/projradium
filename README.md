# Project Radium
**Project Radium** comprises of two mods that aim to improve the soundscape of ArmA 3 by adding new sounds and music to the *real-time Zeus editor.*

The GitHub repository serves as a easy way to commit changes and add new songs without much hassle.

### Radium's Custom Soundtracks [RCS]

A high-quality, soundtrack mod that adds over **200** songs to your Zeus experience.

### Radium's Awesome Soundpack [RAS]

Unique, high-quality sounds packaged and tailored for use in the Zeus editor.

### Want to Contribute?
- ArmA 3 only accepts `.ogg` files. Please don't merge `.mp3` or other file formats.
- Make sure you name the filename appropriately. Although most of the mod is not natively in it, I would prefer if you use `camelCase` for file names. *e.g. RCS_songName.ogg*
- Only change parts of the code that you need to. If you're adding a song or sound, only add in those bits of code. Please do not change my code or anyone elses without permission.

# Installing The Mods

- First, it is important to note that although **RAS** is available on Workshop, **RCS** is not. This is because the Steam Workshop Subscriber Agreement *does not cover Fair Use of copyrighted songs*, and as a result putting **RCS** up on the workshop is not allowed. No profit is earned from **RCS** at all, nor does it affect the market of any copyrighted songs.

#### Installing RCS as a Local Mod
- The first step to install the mod is to first download the latest release of the mod on GitHub, in the releases tab.

- When opening the releases tab, you will notice that the **Latest Release** is always at the top.

**1:** Latest release and tags.

**2:** Description of the release.

**3:** The `.rar` archive provided with the release.
> NOTE: Due to the size of the mod, you may find a lone **README.txt** inside the `rcs_x.x.rar` instead. The link inside of this document will redirect you to a mirror link to download the mod.

- To download the latest version, you will need to download the `.rar`. Ensure you have WinRar or some unzipping tool to extract this file.

- Upon extracting the file, you will notice that inside there is a `@RCS` folder present. This is the mod folder. You will find these files inside:

- It is not important to worry about these files. Move the `@RCS` folder somewhere accessible, and open your ArmA 3 Launcher. There is an option to add a **Local mod**, which is what you will click. Upon clicking, you can navigate to where the `@RCS` folder is, and add it.

- When you've added `@RCS` as a local mod, you're done!

- **Note that you will have to redo these steps everytime there is an update, and remove the mod, replacing it with the fresh new update. Never overwrite the mod! Always delete it through launcher and reinstall it.**

*If there are questions or business queries related to the legal use of this mod, you can contact me via my personal email on my profile. You may not monetize RCS on a server or re-upload it in any form on Steam Workshop.*
